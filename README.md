# data_learning_projects
Projects for learning data analytics numpy pandas etc
My goal is to learn data analytics, and all the associated libraries. I am going to work towards building a tool to analyze player performance for some of my favorite footballers on the USMNT, Premier League teams, etc.
Wish me luck!
